# Screen-Capture
a simple python screen capture (pyhton + bash) in the future will be cross platform(macos/win).

# Goal
I made this as a way to create a timelapse of my WebDev and Games work, essentially when ever I'm working I'll capture and at the end of the day I'll have a folder of around 5k images. 
After I have a folder of images it's just a simple ffmpeg bash script to render it all to a sped up time lapse of my days work. These can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe1UkUm2Aa1rjrCSMny369g/videos
